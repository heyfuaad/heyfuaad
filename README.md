# Hey, I'm Fuaad 👋

I'm a software product engineer working on the intersection of AI & the Internet. Over the last 7 years I have:

→ engineered at a social crowdfunding platform that raised $680M+ to date
→ built and led an influencer marketing platform with 300M+ influencers
→ scaled a $250M+ GMV pharma marketplace serving 10k+ companies
→ built 10+ SaaS products and mobile apps

My coding journey started in high school, fueled by a passion to take on challenges beyond the standard curriculum. I began with freelance web development for local businesses, which soon evolved into building web apps, collaborating with agencies, and eventually launching my own SaaS products.

I’ve worked with numerous startups, taken on roles as a founding engineer, led engineering teams, and collaborated with some truly inspiring individuals.

I occasionally document my journey on [fua.ad/blog](https://fua.ad/blog). It's a personal journal—sometimes random, sometimes technical, sometimes philosophical—but always honest. I also run a newsletter which you can subscribe to here: [fua.ad/newsletter](fua.ad/newsletter)
