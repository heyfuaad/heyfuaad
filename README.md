**Software Product Engineer | 7+ years in Web | Built and led at top influencer marketing platform | Scaled $250M+ GMV pharma marketplace | Going full AI now, duh**

Over the past 7+ years, I've:

My coding journey began in high school, driven by a desire to tackle challenges beyond the traditional curriculum.
