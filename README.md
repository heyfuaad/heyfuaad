**Software Product Engineer | 7+ years in Web | Built and led an influencer marketing platform with 300M+ influencers | Scaled $250M+ GMV pharma marketplace | Going full AI now, duh**

I'm a software product engineer working on the intersection of AI & the Internet. Over the last 7 years I have:

‚Üí engineered at a social crowdfunding platform that raised $680M+ to date
‚Üí built and led an influencer marketing platform with 300M+ influencers
‚Üí scaled a $250M+ GMV pharma marketplace serving 10k+ companies

My coding journey started in high school, fueled by a passion to take on challenges beyond the standard curriculum. I began with freelance web development for local businesses, which soon evolved into building web apps, collaborating with agencies, and eventually launching my own SaaS products.

I‚Äôve worked with numerous startups, taken on roles as a founding engineer, led engineering teams, and collaborated with some truly inspiring individuals.
