# Hey, I'm Fuaad ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software product engineer working on the intersection of AI & the Internet. Over the last 7 years I have:

- engineered at a social crowdfunding platform that raised $680M+ to date
- built and led an influencer marketing platform with 300M+ influencers
- scaled a $250M+ GMV pharma marketplace serving 10k+ companies
- built 10+ SaaS products and mobile apps

I occasionally document my journey on [fua.ad/blog](https://fua.ad/blog). It's a personal journalâ€”sometimes random, sometimes technical, sometimes philosophicalâ€”but always honest. I also run a newsletter which you can subscribe to here: [fua.ad/newsletter](fua.ad/newsletter)

You can reach me here: hey@fua.ad or book a meeting with me here: [fua.ad/contact](fua.ad/contact)
